# Welcome!
Hi there! My name is Rosey, but you can also call me Kai if you know me by that name~ If you've spotted me on PT, I'm usually there for a variety of reasons; I might be recovering from a chronic flare up and just want to chill, I may be working on art/new pony skins, or I may be eepy and just want to chill with small horses. I'm almost always on the 18+ server, but I'm a SFW player. I don't engage in NSFW stuff on PonyTown.

Something important to note; I don't roleplay - Sorry!

# Hides & Blocks
If I hide you, it's most likely temporarily. Sometimes I like to take screenshots of ppl's cool skins to add to my drawlist folder. Otherwise, if you have a really annoying skin (penis/piss/fetish/etc), it's probably a 24hour block. I clear my blocks out pretty regularly. Unless you're portraying something like a Nazi/Trump/Political skin, then it's probably permanent. Additionally, if you're underaged and share your age in chat - you'll also get blocked. Kids shouldn't be in the 18+ server.

If you're being particularly annoying or spamming, I'll probably temp block you then as well.

# Friend Requests
I'll pretty much accept most friend requests, but if your online activity says you haven't been online in over 90days (3 months) and I don't know you elsewhere I'll likely remove you. It's nothing personal, I just like to keep my lists clean especially on places that have limits.

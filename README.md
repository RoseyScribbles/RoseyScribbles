# This is a Work in Progress~
Hi there! My name is Rosey, but you can also call me Kai if you know me by that name~ If you've spotted me on PT, I'm usually there for a variety of reasons; I might be recovering from a chronic flare up and just want to chill, I may be working on art/new pony skins, or I may be eepy and just want to chill with small horses.

Something important to note; I don't roleplay - Sorry!
